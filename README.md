- 👋 Hi, I’m @albericpl
- 👀 I’m a biologist by trade and a hobbyist when it comes to coding.
- 🌱 I mostly work with R, a little HTML and maybe some Python in the future.
- 💞️ This is a personal account where I can experiment and practice.
- ⌛ Maybe this can turn into a very informal portfolio of sorts, in time.
